### Roadmap for the next big update! :dart:
- [x] ~~Establish a server that will serve static files~~
- [ ] Convert all existing code to TypeScript
- [ ] Instead of using vanilla Javascript, I'll migrate to Pixi.js
- [ ] Update the server for multiplayer support
- [ ] Add a new gamemode "Duel" (1v1)
- [ ] Revamp the UI

This roadmap requires a lot of development. So I'll not put the specific time of when will be the next update. It's just there so you'll have an Idea what's the future of PeewPeew :smiling_face_with_three_hearts:
